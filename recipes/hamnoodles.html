    <h2>Description</h2>
   
    <p>Fans of <strong>Ponyo</strong> will remember Ponyo’s obsession 
    with food, especially her love for ham. The umami 
    dish doesn’t have an official name, but it goes by 
    a few names – such as ham noodles, Ponyo noodles, 
    and Ponyo ramen. Here’s how you can level up your 
    instant noodles with just 2 ingredients:</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 packet instant noodles</li>
        <li>water</li>
        <li>1 slice cooked ham</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>Spring onion (Scallion)</li>
        <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps to cook:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil water.</li>
        <li>Transfer the boiling water in to a saucepan.
        Add the egg and more boiling water until the egg
        is fully submerged.</li>
        <li>Cover the saucepan with a lid and wait around
        8 minutes, or more depending on how cooked you want
        the egg.</li>
        <li>While the egg is cooking, slice the spring 
        onion in to small pieces and set aside.</li>
        <li>Slice the cooked ham in to halves and set
        aside.</li>
        <li>Once the egg is fully cooked, retrieve from 
        the saucepan, remove shell and cut in to halves and
        set aside.</li>
        <li>Add instant noodles to a bowl, pour boiling
        water over the noodles and cover with a lid. Set
        aside for 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>After the first minute, separate the noodles
        and add the ham slices, hard boiled egg and spring
        onion. Cover with a lid again.</li>
        <li>Wait the remaining 2-3 minutes, and the dish
        is ready to eat!</li>
    </ol>
