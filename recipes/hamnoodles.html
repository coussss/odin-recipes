    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Our best ever spaghetti bolognese is super 
    easy and a true Italian classic with a meaty,
    chilli sauce.</p>
    <p>The flavors come together so nicely in this 
    spaghetti, no one will believe it’s 
    made with plain canned tomato sauce and
    it’s ready in only 10 minutes!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Spaghetti</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Oregano</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps to cook the spaghetti pasta</h3>
    <p>Everything cooks in one pot for this spaghetti 
    with tomato sauce recipe!</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook spaghetti:</strong> Fill a large Dutch 
        oven or pot with cold water 3/4 full and bring 
        to a boil. Add 2 tsp salt and spaghetti</li>
        <li><strong>Ensure pasta does not stick 
        together:</strong> Seperate pasta with tongs
        a few times during the first 2 minutes of cooking
        to ensure it does not stick. Keep cooking 
        uncovered for 5 more minutes until sufficiently
        soft, yet still slightly firm</li>
        <li><strong>Drain pasta:</strong> Test the spaghetti
        for doneness towards the end by grabbing one strand
        on to a plate with tongs. The key to good pasta is
        pasta with a bite. Drain in to a collander</li>
        <li><strong>Cook garlic:</strong>Return the pot
        to medium head and add the olive oil, 4 cloves
        garlic, and oregano. Cook for 1 minute, stirring
        occasionally.</li>
        <li><strong>Add remaining ingredients:</strong>
        Drained pasta, tomato sauce, remaining 1/2 tsp salt,
        ground black pepper and add 1 more fresh garlic 
        clove. Stir gently until warmed through.</li>
        <li><strong>Sprinkle with parmesan</strong>...
        and serve immediately!</li>
    </ol>
