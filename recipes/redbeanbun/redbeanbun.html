    <h2>Description</h2>
   
    <p>The <strong>Steamed Red Bean Bun</strong> was 
    sighted in the best animated film of all time – 
    <em>Spirited Away</em>. Chihiro, the protagonist, 
    munched on a mega-sized red bean steamed bun as she 
    gazed into the night. While it’s much easier to buy 
    it from a supermarket, making this pastry from scratch 
    can be pretty fun and satisfying.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup red beans</li>
        <li>5 cups water</li>
        <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>4 cups flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp instant yeast</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps to cook:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the red beans thoroughly before 
        transferring into a cooker.</li>
        <li>Add in 3 cups of water and cook for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Add sugar and vanilla extract into the rice 
        cooker. Keep stirring until the water is fully 
        absorbed by the red beans. This might take up to 
        1 hour.</li>
        <li>Set aside and wait for it to cool down.</li>
        <li>Mix flour, 2 cups of lukewarm water, and yeast 
        in an electric mixer until it forms a smooth dough.</li>
        <li>Knead for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place the dough into a bowl and cover with 
        cling wrap. Wait for an hour until the dough has 
        risen to twice of its original size.</li>
        <li>Add the cooled red bean compote into a blender.
        Blend until smooth.</li>
        <li>Add more flour on the surface of the dough and 
        knead the dough into balls bigger than your palms.</li>
        <li>Flatten each ball and place some red bean 
        paste into the middle of the dough. Slowly stretch 
        and seal the dough around the red bean paste.</li>
        <li>Leave the dough under a wet towel for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add parchment paper into a steamer and place 
        the buns inside. Steam for about 12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat for 1-2 minutes and the 
        steamed buns are ready to eat!</li>
    </ol>
